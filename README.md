## Playing

* left-click draws... drag things in a direction.
* right-click removes
* wsad (or arrows): pans
* 1 - 10: selects a tile (or click on tile in HUD)

You need a "source", and "passers"

## Next types:

* multitransfor: a + b -> c
* source: extracts from groundchunk

## Next todos:

* better handshake when taking/accepting/reliquishing
* lock mouse when dragging.
* scroll at edges of window
* reading ground chunk from machine chunk
* can taker-picker stuck items
* fix out-of-bounds clicks
* don't affect previous items for a few ticks (so it doens't just dump them as drawing)
* make something playable for others
* smarter path dragging (on corners)
* weird tile placing position if window too small

* trains
* water - auto-boats

## Notes

Make it more "rube goldberg-y" - things flying through the air and caught etc.

The factory part is weird alien icky... but it produces happy lovely products for the people. They don't konw what lurks inside.

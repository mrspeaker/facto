# facto

## Next types:

* multitransfor: a + b -> c
* source: extracts from groundchunk

## Next todos:

* hold to destroy (can't paint on existing (except to rotate))
* reading ground chunk from machine chunk
* can taker-picker stuck items
* fix out-of-bounds clicks
* fix cursor/hover scaling
* don't affect previous items for a few ticks (so it doens't just dump them as drawing)

## Notes

* passers should be takers too - easier. No "belt" concept so inserters are overkill

...
tiles can be *takers*, *pasers*, or *both*.

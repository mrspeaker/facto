# facto

## Next types:

* multitransfor: a + b -> c
* source: extracts from groundchunk
* switcher: passer, but alternates if choice

## Next todos:

* fix taker/passer anim
* reading ground chunk from machine chunk
* can taker-picker stuck items
* fix out-of-bounds clicks
* fix cursor/hover scaling
* don't affect previous items for a few ticks (so it doens't just dump them as drawing)


## Notes

* passers could be takers too - easier. No "belt" concept so inserters are overkill

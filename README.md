## Playing

* left-click draws... drag things in a direction.
* right-click removes
* wsad (or arrows): pans
* 1 - 10: selects a tile (or click on tile in HUD)
* mouse up/down: zoom (change this!)

You need a "source", a "taker-giver" and "passers"

## Next types:

* multitransfor: a + b -> c
* source: extracts from groundchunk

## Next todos:

* reading ground chunk from machine chunk
* can taker-picker stuck items
* fix out-of-bounds clicks
* fix cursor/hover scaling
* don't affect previous items for a few ticks (so it doens't just dump them as drawing)
* make something playable for others

## Notes

* passers should be takers too - easier. No "belt" concept so inserters are overkill
> tiles should be *takers*, *pasers*, or *both*.

Make it more "rube goldberg-y" - things flying through the air and caught etc.

The factory part is weird alien icky... but it produces happy lovely products for the people. They don't konw what lurks inside.
